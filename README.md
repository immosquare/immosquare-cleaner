## Linter Configurations

You can view the specific configurations for all supported linters in the [linters folder](https://github.com/immosquare/immosquare-cleaner/tree/main/linters) of the repository.

## Installation

**Prerequisite**: Please be sure to have [bun](https://bun.sh/) installed. This is necessary to launch eslint & prettier commands.

For the Ruby gem:

```ruby
gem "immosquare-cleaner"
```

Then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

For the npm module:

Add `immosquare-cleaner` to your development dependencies. For instance, using `bun`:

```bash
$ bun add immosquare-cleaner
```

## Usage

To clean a specific file:

```ruby
ImmosquareCleaner.clean("path/to/your/file.rb")
```

### Configuration

Tailor the behavior of the gem/module with the provided configuration options:

```ruby
ImmosquareCleaner.config do |config|
  # Set custom rubocop options
  config.rubocop_options = "--your-rubocop-options-here"
  # Set custom htmlbeautifier options
  config.htmlbeautifier_options = "--your-htmlbeautifier-options-here"
  # Set custom erblint options
  config.erblint_options = "--your-erblint-options-here"
end
```

## Integration with Visual Studio Code

Automate the cleaning process for all files upon saving in VS Code:

1. Install the [Run on Save](https://github.com/emeraldwalk/vscode-runonsave) extension from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Add the following configuration to your `settings.json` in VS Code:

```json
"emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
  "commands": [
    {
      "match": ".*",
      "cmd": "if bundle info immosquare-cleaner &>/dev/null; then bundle exec immosquare-cleaner '${file}'; else echo 'please install the gem immosquare-cleaner'; fi"
    }
  ]
}
```

With the above, every time you save a file in VS Code, it will automatically be cleaned using `immosquare-cleaner`.
